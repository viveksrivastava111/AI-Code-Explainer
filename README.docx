🔍 AI Code Explainer
AI Code Explainer is a lightweight and privacy-friendly web application built with Streamlit, designed to help users understand Python code by generating natural language explanations. It leverages a locally hosted GPT-Neo language model (EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M) from Hugging Face Transformers, eliminating the need for internet access or cloud-based APIs.

✨ Key Features
💻 Offline-First Architecture
Works entirely offline after the model is downloaded. No cloud dependency, no API keys, and no data sent to external servers — your code and explanations stay local.

🧠 Powered by GPT-Neo 125M
Uses the open-source EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M model to interpret Python code and convert it into beginner-friendly explanations in real time.

🧾 Beginner-Friendly Language
Explanations are phrased in simple, understandable English, making this tool ideal for students, self-learners, and non-technical collaborators.

🚀 Streamlit-Based UI
The application features a modern, intuitive interface using Streamlit, ensuring smooth user interaction and quick deployment across platforms.

🎯 Educational Utility
Great for classrooms, tutorials, and self-paced learning environments where understanding the “why” behind the code is as important as the “how.”

🛠 Requirements
To run this application locally, make sure you have the following:
✅ Python 3.8 or higher
✅ Streamlit
✅ Hugging Face Transformers
✅ PyTorch (required for running the model)

🚀 How It Works
1-Paste your Python code into the input field.
2-Click the "Explain Code" button.
3-The app formats a prompt and sends it to the local GPT-Neo model.
4-The model responds with a concise, easy-to-understand explanation.
5-You get a natural language breakdown of what your code does.

💡 Why Local?
-No cost associated with cloud APIs (like OpenAI)
-No risk of leaking sensitive code online
-Fully functional in offline environments (e.g., secure labs or classrooms without internet)

🔐 Privacy & Security
This app does not send your code to any remote server. All computation is performed on your local device, offering total control and peace of mind regarding code confidentiality.
